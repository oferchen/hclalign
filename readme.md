# hclalign

`hclalign` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to organize and align HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) files.

## Features

- **Flexible File Selection**: Use glob patterns to target specific files or groups of files for alignment.
- **Customizable Field Order**: Define your preferred order of variable block fields to maintain a consistent format across HCL files.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages Go's concurrency capabilities to process files in parallel, optimizing performance on multicore systems.
- **Debugging Support**: Includes a debug mode for additional logging, useful for troubleshooting and development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have Go installed on your system to build and run `hclalign`.

### Installation

Clone the `hclalign` repository and use the Makefile to build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oferchen/hclalign.git
cd hclalign
make init
make tidy
make build
```

This will compile the project, creating an executable named `hclalign` in the current directory.

### Basic Commands

To get started with `hclalign`, here are some Makefile commands you might find useful:

- **Build**: `make build` compiles the project into an executable.
- **Run**: `make run` builds and executes `hclalign`.
- **Dependencies**: `make deps` downloads the required project dependencies.
- **Tidy**: `make tidy` cleans and verifies the module dependencies.
- **Test**: `make test` runs all configured tests.
- **Clean**: `make clean` removes temporary files and the executable to clean up the project space.
- **Init**: `make init` initializes a new Go module for the project.
- **Help**: `make help` displays available Makefile commands.

## Usage

Execute `hclalign` with your target directory or file and optional flags for criteria and order:

```sh
./hclalign [target file or directory] --criteria "*.tf,*.hcl" --order "description,type,default,sensitive,nullable,validation"
```

### Command Line Flags

- `--criteria, -c`: Glob patterns for selecting files (default: `*.tf`).
- `--order, -o`: Specify the order of variable block fields (default: `description,type,default,sensitive,nullable,validation`).

## Examples

**Before `hclalign`**, a Terraform variable file might look like this:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of instances to launch"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}
```

**After running `hclalign`**, the file would be reorganized for improved clarity:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of instances to launch"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}
```
